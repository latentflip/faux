Functions
===

As described in [Methods][m] and the [README][readme], you can supply a function to be used as a step or as `before_` or `after_` step advice. There are a couple of different ways to specify a function.

The simplest is a function that does something for side-effects:

    before_display: function () {
      window.console && console.log('some debugging information');
    }

You can access the parameters:

    after_display: function (params) {
      window.console && console.log('some debugging information', params);
    }

Since that function doesn't return anything, the parameters would not be affected. If you want to change or augment the parameters, simply return a hash:

    before_display: function (params) {
      params.ul = jQuery('.some_class#' + params.id);
      return params;
    }

Faux has its own options. You can access them if you think you know what you are doing. This is a sharp knife and is not supported:

    fetch_data: function (params, options) {
      window.console && console.log('let\'s take a peek', options);
    }
    
Finally, you can define a function that takes a callback. You must declare all three parameters and Faux will pass you a callback that you must call unless there is an error of some sort. You must pass in the params and the options:

    fetch_data: function (params, options, callback) {
      jQuery.get(some_url, { ... }, success);
      
      function success (data, textStatus, XMLHttpRequest) {
        // do something
        params.more_data = data;
        callback(params, options);
      }
    }
    
**great expectations**

When Faux expects a function to be used as a step or as `before_` or `after_` step advice, there are three rules:

*Rule One*: If Faux expects a function to be used as a step or as `before_` or `after_` step advice, and you supply something that is a function, Faux accepts the function. So if you write:

    before_display: function () {
      window.console && console.log('some debugging information');
    }
    
By Rule One, Faux accepts the function.

*Rule Two*: If Faux expects a function to be used as a step or as `before_` or `after_` step advice, and you supply something that is not a function but it implements a method called `.toFunction()`, Faux calls its `.toFunction()` method and accepts the result.

Rule Two is easy to understand. For example, if you use `String.prototype.toFunction()` from [Functional Javascript][functional], every string implements to `.toFunction()` method. Therefore, if you write this:

    before_display: "window.console && console.log('some debugging information')"
    
It is equivalent to writing this:

    before_display: "window.console && console.log('some debugging information')".toFunction()

*Rule Three*: If Faux expects a function to be used as a step or as `before_` or `after_` step advice, and you supply a hash that is not a function and does not implement the `.toFunction()` method, Faux constructs a function that takes the parameters as an argument and returns a new hash.

The new hash consists of each of the keys of your hash, but Faux expects a function for each value. Faux uses rules one and two on these value functions, but not Rule Three.

An example is worth a thousand words. This example using Rule Three—

    before_display: {
      
      id: function (params) {
        return params.castle.id;
      },
      
      model: function (params) {
        return params.castle;
      },
      
      el: function (params) {
        return jQuery('.properties#'+params.castle.id);
      }
      
    }

—is equivalent to this example using Rule One:

    before_display: function (params) {
      return {
        id:    params.castle.id,
        model: params.castle,
        el:    jQuery('.properties#'+params.castle.id)
      };
    }

Why bother with Rule Three? Well, if you don't use `String.prototype.toFunction()` or anything else like that, it may not be worth the trouble. However, consider this version using `String.prototype.toFunction()` and Rule Two:

    before_display: {
        id:    ".castle.id",
        model: ".castle",
        el:    "jQuery('.properties#'+_.castle.id)"
    }
