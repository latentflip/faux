// From Backbone.js's `Backbone.Controller` [documentation](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Controller):

// Creating a new controller
//--

// A `Faux.Controller` instance is a `Backbone.Controller`, with additional methods added for defining routes
// by convention and providing `route_to` helpers for temnplates.
//
// Controller methods can be invoked in two ways. First, with a route. For example,
// `#/wake` invokes `controller.wake()`, just like directly calling `controller.wake()`.
// Declaring `location: true` when configuring the controller declares that when we
// directly call controller methods, we want the controller to save the current location, i.e. to
// set the fragment to `#/wake` when we directly invoke `controller.wake()`.
//
// (It's an unfortunate coïncidence that the controller option `save_location` looks an awful lot like
// it has something to do with this application's location routes and method, but that's all
// it is, a coïncidence.)
//
// By default, we want to use [Backbone.Model](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Model) classes
// for everything passed to views. Since we're passing `true`, we want Faux to infer the name of
// each model from the name of the controller method, i.e. The model for `controller.location` will
// be `location`.
//
// Place content in the `div` with a class of `content`
//
// Haml partials are found in the `haml` directory, and the default suffix for haml files is `.haml`
//
// Javascript files containing models, collections, and views can be found in the `javascripts` path.
//
// The default window title shall be `Misadventure`
var controller = new Faux.Controller({
  save_location: true,
  element_selector: '.content',
  partial: 'haml',
  partial_suffix: '.haml',
  javascript: 'javascripts',
  title: 'Misadventure'
});


// Defining controller methods
// ---

// We're going to define three controller methods, `controller.wake()`, `controller.location({...})`,
// and `controller.bed({...})`
controller

// `.begin` establishes a new scope. All three method will share a common set of "translations."
// These translations tell Faux how to turn a collection of `locations` into a `seed`, and how to 
// turn a `seed` into a collection of `locations`.
  .begin({
    'seed=': {
      locations: function (locations) { return locations.seed; },
      '': function () { return Math.random().toString().substring(2); }
    },
    'locations=': {
      seed: function (seed) { return LocationCollection.find_or_create({ seed: seed }); }
    }
  })
  
    //`controller.wake()` will have a route of `#/wake`, and it will initialize its own `locations`.
    // Since there is no `WakeView` defined, it will display the parameters directly in a template 
    // of `/haml/wake.haml`.
    //
    // This also defines `route_to_wake()`.
    .method('wake')

    // `controller.bed({...})` will have a route of `#/:seed/bed` and will use a `BedView` to
    // display a template of `/haml/bed.haml`.
    //
    // This also defines `route_to_bed({ seed: '42' })`. Thanks to the translations, you can
    // also call `route_to_bed({ locations: location_collection })`.
    .method('bed', {
      route: ':seed/bed'
    })
  
    // `controller.location({...})` will have a route of `#/:seed/location_id` and will use a 
    // `LocationView` to display a template of `/haml/bed.haml`.
    //
    // This also defines `route_to_location({ seed: '42', location_id: '6' })`. Thanks to the 
    // translations, you can also call `route_to_location({ location: location })`. Faux deals
    // with some magic like extracting `location.collection` to get `locations` and `location.id`
    // to get `location_id`. This is all possible because of the translations and the use of
    // naming conventions.
    .method('location', {
      route: ':seed/:location_id'
    })
    
    // ends a `.begin({...})` scope
    .end()
  
    ;

// Kick off the application, and invoke `controller.wake()` if no fragment is provided.
$(function() {
  controller.define_all(function () {
    Backbone.history.start();
    window.location.hash || controller.wake();
  });
});
	
})();
